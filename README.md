### Afterword 
**Hi person, who will examine my solution** ðŸ‘‹\
I just wanted to say that even, if I'm not going to pass this part of the 
recruitment this project was fun. I did not have any experience with 
electron.js, so grasping the concepts in such a short time was a challenge. After all I did learn a new technology, experienced new problems (and solved them).\
**Thank you** for this task, ***MichaÅ‚***
